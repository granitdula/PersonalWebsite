            <p class="paragraphs">As a software developer I have a great passion
            for problem solving and creating tools and projects that help to
            solve potential issues. I enjoy seeing the end result after
            dedicating my time to a certain project.<br><br>As well as just creating
            projects, Iâ€™m also curious to know how systems work which is what
            spurred my interest in programming and computer science in the first
            place. What is great about programming is that it can be applied in
            almost any situation from electronics to websites and applications.

                Its aim is to help make the experience for children in the

                and blocking incoming targets within a certain time limit. It
                uses the Microsoft Mixed reality and Microsoft Kinect to read

                Tuberculosis vaccines. This was part of an engineering module in
                our university course. It required using a MSP430
                Microcontroller to program the control systems and send it the
                data to the UI shown above and allow users to control the values.</p>

            electronics with programming, as well as an information security
            research website during my first year of University. I am currently
            working on a game which is a 2D shooter platformer, where I have tried
            to create not only the code, but also the art, animation and sound
            entirely myself to try to keep it unique.</p>
